What is express.js?
It is a framework that has a lot of utility functions that help us rowk with request and responses more elegantly so tha twe can focus on busines slogics

Alternatives to expressjs:
vanilla node.js
adonis.js
koa
sails.js

To install express, we can simply do 
node install --save express
we use --sav eand not --save-dev because it is required in the production as well

Express follows a middleware pattern

Request ===> Middleware ==[next()]==> Middleware ==[next()]==> Response

THis pattern gives express its plugable nature

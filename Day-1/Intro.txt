What is nodejs?
It is a runtime that help us run javascript code in the server.
Node js builds on top of v8 engine. V8 engine is used by chrome browser to run javascript.
THe V8 machine compiles the javascript code into machine code.
V8 is writtten in c++;

To get started with node, install it from the nodejs website:

At the time of learning, the latest LTS version was 18.17.1.
Node comes bundled with npm, the node package manager.

To check for the version of node on your system, run the command:
node -v or node --version

Enter interactive mode of node by using the 'node' command.
Exit this mode by pressing Ctrl+C or entering .exit

To execute our node files, use the node <file_name> command.

Node does not necessarily have to be used for server side code. 
We can also use it to create utility scripts.

What is node.js?
It is a javascript runtime that can be run on server. While javascript was initially meant to be run on the browser.
But with node.js, we can run javascript code on the server (or any machine/environment)

Node js uses V8 engine to run js on server. The same engine developed by google to execute javascript on the browser

V8 is written in c++. V8 takes in javascript code, and then compiles it to machine code.

Node REPL (Read Eval Print Loop)
we can enter node REPL by simply running rone on the console.
Codes in the REPL is not saved anywhere. It can be used for simple node code analysis
